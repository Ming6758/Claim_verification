            "['Jason Bourne () is the title character and the protagonist in a series of novels and subsequent film adaptations. The character was created by novelist Robert Ludlum. He first appeared in the novel The Bourne Identity (1980), which was adapted for television in 1988. The novel was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 2002 and starred Matt Damon in the lead role.\\nThe character originally featured in three novels by Ludlum, released between 1980 and 1990, followed by eleven novels written by Eric Van Lustbader between 2004 and 2019, and three novels by Brian Freeman since 2020.  Along with the first feature film, Jason Bourne also appears in three sequel films The Bourne Supremacy (2004),  The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), and Jason Bourne (2016), with Damon again in the lead role. Jeremy Renner stars in the fourth film of the franchise, The Bourne Legacy, released in August 2012. Damon stated in interviews that he would not do another Bourne film without Paul Greengrass, who had directed the second and third installments. Greengrass agreed to direct Damon in the fifth installment in the franchise. Greengrass jointly wrote the screenplay with editor Christopher Rouse.\\n\\n\\n== Literary backstory ==\\nJason Bourne is one of many aliases used by David Webb, a career Foreign Service Officer, and a specialist in Far Eastern affairs. Before the events in The Bourne Identity, Webb had a Thai wife named Dao and two children named Joshua and Alyssa in Phnom Penh.  Webb\\'s wife and children were killed during the Vietnam War when a fighter plane strayed into Cambodia, dropped two bombs, and strafed a spot near the Mekong River. However, unknown to Webb, Joshua survived. Due to Cambodia\\'s neutrality in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility for the incident. Enraged by both the injustice and randomness of his loss, Webb went to Saigon and, under the careful guidance of friend and CIA officer Alexander Conklin, ended up training for an elite top secret Special Forces unit called \"Medusa\". Within that select organization Webb was known only by his code name, \"Delta One\".\\n\\n\\n=== Medusa ===\\nAn assassination team or death squad, Medusa, was created to infiltrate Northern Vietnam and assassinate members of the Viet Cong and its collaborators. Its members were criminals; its leader, a man called Delta, ran Medusa with an iron fist. He became well known for his ruthlessness, his disregard for orders, and his disturbing success rate on missions, resulting in the kidnapping of Webb\\'s brother, U.S. Army Lieutenant Gordon Webb, during his tour of duty in Saigon.\\nDuring the mission to save Gordon Webb, an original \"Medusa\" team member named Jason Charles Bourne was discovered to be a double agent who alerted a large number of North Vietnamese soldiers to their whereabouts. When Delta found Bourne after killing his way through the North Vietnamese, he simply killed Bourne in the jungles of Tam Quan. Bourne\\'s execution was never exposed due to the top secret status of Medusa.\\n\\n\\n=== Operation Treadstone ===\\nYears later, a black ops arm of the CIA, called \"Treadstone Seventy-One\" after a building on New York\\'s Seventy-First Street, was formed to eliminate the notorious Carlos the Jackal. Webb was called up by David Abbott, nicknamed \"The Monk\", to be its principal agent. At this point, Webb (Delta) took the identity of Jason Bourne, due to the actual Bourne\\'s status as MIA in the war, as well as the fact that Bourne was in reality a brutal killer with a long criminal record. The point was to turn \"Jason Bourne\" into an elite, ruthlessly efficient assassin who would be feared by terrorists and criminals worldwide. The assassin\\'s alias was \"Cain\". The reasoning for creating such a myth was to create competition for the well-known assassin named \"Carlos\", or \"Carlos the Jackal\" (real name Ilich Ramírez Sánchez) who at that time was considered the world\\'s best and most famous assassin. By creating this myth, Cain was to drive the reclusive Carlos out into the open \"long enough to put a bullet in his head\".\\n\\n\\n== Film backstory ==\\nIn the film series, Jason Bourne is revealed to have been born David Webb on September 13, 1970 (or June 4, 1978 in Jason Bourne) in Nixa, Missouri (although in Ultimatum, he is given a false date of April 15, 1971, as a coded reference to a specific site). In flashbacks, he joins the United States Army and is eventually selected for the CIA Treadstone program in 1997. His father, Richard Webb, a senior CIA analyst, is responsible for creating Treadstone, a black ops project intended to train and deploy elite assassins. The CIA murders his father with a false flag car bomb in Beirut in a bid to recruit Webb.\\nThe ploy worked; Webb approaches the CIA and is brought into the program by Neil Daniels, a supervisor in the Treadstone program, while being monitored by Dr. Albert Hirsch, who supervises the medical assessment of Treadstone agents. He is brought into a secret recruitment center in New York City, where Hirsch orders him tortured for days — via waterboarding and sleep deprivation — to break his spirit and allow him to be molded into an assassin. He is officially accepted when he murders an unidentified man (implied to be the real Jason Bourne) without question. After that, he is given a new identity as Jason Bourne, and his true identity becomes a classified secret.\\nAfter heavy training, in which he learns several languages and masters a wide array of martial arts skills, Bourne is placed in the Treadstone program, whose missions are run by Conklin. His first assignment, an unofficial one, is revealed to have happened in Berlin, Germany: the assassination of Vladimir Neski, a Russian politician who was intending to expose the theft of $20 million in secret funds stolen from the CIA by Treadstone\\'s Director, Ward Abbott, and a Russian oligarch, Yuri Gretkov. Under Conklin\\'s orders, Bourne murders Neski and his wife and makes it look like a murder-suicide.\\nBourne works in the program as its top agent for three years, stationed in Paris, France, maintaining a secluded life while performing assassinations, mostly around Europe. His official handler is logistics agent Nicky Parsons, also stationed in Paris, who is implied to have feelings for Bourne that she keeps hidden from Treadstone employers.\\nThe turning point in his life comes after an order to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord who was blackmailing the CIA into reinstating him as head of state, lest he expose several CIA secrets. Using an alias, John Michael Kane, Bourne gathers information on Wombosi. He infiltrates the warlord\\'s yacht and hides inside it for five days, surfacing on a cold night in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, intending to arrange the murder to look like Wombosi was killed by a crew member. However, Wombosi is surrounded by his children, and Bourne is unable to bring himself to kill him. He tries to abandon the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown person shoots him twice in the back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing Webb / Bourne to forget his identity.\\n\\n\\n== Appearances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Novels ===\\nThe series has included fifteen novels which have been written by two authors, Robert Ludlum and Eric Van Lustbader. Ludlum\\'s series include the first three books, dubbed the Bourne trilogy. After Ludlum\\'s death in 2001, Lustbader took over the character in his own series of novels, which span eleven books as of 2020. A twelfth novel, The Bourne Nemesis, was scheduled to be released in 2019, but as of July 2020 is no longer expected to be published.\\n\\n\\n==== Written by Robert Ludlum ====\\n\\n\\n===== The Bourne Identity (1980) =====\\n\\nA man is found floating unconscious in the Mediterranean Sea near Marseille by Italian fishermen with two gunshot wounds in his back. He wakes and discovers he has extreme memory loss. Film negative embedded in his hip leads him to a bank in Zurich where he learns he is known by the name Jason Bourne. As he tries to reclaim his memory, Bourne attracts the attention of hostile people for reasons unknown to him. At a hotel, while cornered, Bourne takes a young woman, Marie St. Jacques, hostage to escape. Marie is an employee of the Government of Canada. Bourne and Marie discover that \"Jason Bourne\" is the cover identity of a contract assassin, and that both the CIA and another contract killer known as Carlos the Jackal have an interest in him. Marie is convinced that this man she has come to know cannot be the ruthless killer that all their discoveries seem to imply. She compels Bourne to continue searching for his true identity and, in the end, he finds the truth. Through this time, Bourne has the phrase \"Cain is for Charlie, and Delta is for Cain\" continually flash through his mind, propelling him in the direction of his mission.\\n\\n\\n===== The Bourne Supremacy (1986) =====\\n\\nHaving recovered his memory and retired from the CIA, David Webb now teaches Asian Studies at a university in Maine and lives with Marie. She is taken captive seemingly by a powerful Chinese drug lord, but in reality, by the United States government using the fictitious drug lord as cover. The scheme is an attempt to turn Webb back into his former self, the mythical Jason Bourne, to go after a Bourne impostor in China. The phony Bourne has been credited with a Far East political assassination that could, in a worst-case scenario, cause a Chinese civil war over the ownership of Hong Kong.\\n\\n\\n===== The Bourne Ultimatum (1990) =====\\n\\nAs an aging Carlos the Jackal\\'s infamy fades, he decides that he will do two things before he dies: kill Jason Bourne and destroy the KGB facility of Novgorod, where the Jackal was trained and later turned away. Webb\\'s family is forced to hide in the Caribbean while Webb himself works with Conklin to hunt down and kill the Jackal. Webb poses as an important member of Medusa, now a nearly omnipotent economic force that controls the commander of NATO, leading figures in the Defense Department, and large NYSE firms. The plan is to use Medusa\\'s resources to contact the Jackal. Webb just misses the Jackal several times before Webb fakes his own death to draw him out. Following this, the Jackal turns to his second goal. Webb tracks the Jackal down with the help of Conklin and a KGB agent as the Jackal begins destroying the KGB compound. In a final confrontation, the Jackal is led into a dam lock in which he drowns, and Webb returns to his family.\\n\\n\\n==== Written by Eric Van Lustbader ====\\n\\n\\n===== The Bourne Legacy (2004) =====\\n\\nWith the climactic events of The Bourne Ultimatum behind him, Jason Bourne is able to once again become David Webb, now professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. However, this serenity does not last for long. When a silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb\\'s head, the Bourne persona reawakens in him. His first objective is to reach Conklin. However, unknown to Bourne, a Hungarian by the name of Stepan Spalko has now led him into a trap—one which he cannot escape as easily as his professional façade. And the man who nearly killed him in Georgetown continues his deadly, intensely personal pursuit.\\n\\n\\n===== The Bourne Betrayal (2007) =====\\n\\nJason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the CIA, Martin Lindros, who disappeared in Africa while tracking shipments of uranium. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of terrorists buying the nuclear material in Odessa. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places and events and he wonders if someone is brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail, or worse, if the man he saved in Africa is really Martin Lindros.

At Oxford, he was also part of a 12-person jazz-house/electronica band called Confidential Collective. After graduating, he competed in and won many rap battle competitions. He competed as Riz MC on JumpOff TV\\'s \"Spin the Mic\" freestyle rap battle contest in 2006.

It was leaked by friends and first gained popularity through the internet. The song was initially banned from British airplay because the lyrics were deemed \"politically sensitive\", including satirical references to 9/11, terrorism, the post-9/11 climate, Iraq War, death of Jean Charles de Menezes, the MI6, and Belmarsh prison. The resulting press coverage, however, prompted some independent radio stations to play the track.

He was featured on the song \"Immigrants (We Get The Job Done)\" in The Hamilton Mixtape, which topped the Billboard 200 chart. This put him in the unique position of sitting at number-one on both the Billboard 200 album chart and the movie box office chart (with Rogue One) at the same time. At the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), \"Immigrants\" won the award for Best Fight Against the System, giving him the rare distinction of winning both the Emmy and VMA awards.\\n\\n\\n== The Riz Test ==\\nIn 2018, Sadia Habib and Shaf Choudry, two researchers in the UK, were inspired by Ahmed to determine a method to quantify the nature of Muslim representation in film and TV. Ultimately they came up with a test they named \"The Riz Test\", which has been compared to the Bechdel test. The test came about following a speech given by Ahmed in 2017 at the House of Commons, in which he addressed what he views as a lack of diversity in film and television. Ahmed has spoken about the lack of accurate representation of Muslims in the arts, and often expresses these views on social media.The Riz Test has five parts which, according to the creators, serve to highlight and combat the stereotypes of Muslims found in characters in films and on TV:\\nIf a character is identifiably Muslim, is the character talking about, the victim of, or the perpetrator of terrorism?\\nPresented as irrationally angry?\\nPresented as superstitious, culturally backwards or anti-modern?\\nPresented as a threat to a Western way of life?\\nIf the character is male, is he presented as misogynistic? or if female, is she presented as oppressed by her male counterparts?One of the tests\\' creators, Shaf Choudry, describes the test as not being \"a scientific measure of Islamophobia, it’s more to prop conversation.\"Ahmed acknowledged the test in 2018, expressing his surprise at the test being named after him and writing on Twitter that he was \"glad to see this\" and that he thought it was \"much needed.\"\\n\\n\\n== Activism ==\\nAs a Muslim, Ahmed has spoken candidly about negative stereotyping of Muslims, both in a personal and societal context. As an activist, he has been involved in raising funds for Syrian refugee children and advocating representation at the House of Commons. He has also been involved in raising awareness of the displacement of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, after Rohingya genocide, and raising funds for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. In 2013, Ahmed provided journalist Hardeep Singh Kohli with a formal apology for a tweet he had published in which he called Singh a \"bigot\" and falsely accused him of attempted assault. Ahmed also agreed to pay him substantial damages for libel and his legal costs.

            "1. The claim states that there were 1978 people on board US Airways Flight 1549. However, the information provided clearly states that there were 150 passengers and 3 flight attendants, for a total of 153 people on board.\n",

            "4. The additional information provided about Corsica's history, such as it being occupied since the Mesolithic era, being considered a backward region by the Romans, and being occupied by various other powers over the centuries, does not directly contradict the claim that France is the current owner of Corsica.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. The information provided includes several relevant details about Nawaz Sharif and his political positions:\n",
            "   - He is described as a \"rightwing tycoon\" who has won over \"leftist liberals\" (Information 1).\n",
            "   - He faced criticism from a protest movement led by Imran Khan and other rival factions of the Muslim League (Information 2).\n",
            "   - He consolidated his power through the 14th Amendment, which prevented legislators from dissenting or voting against their own parties (Information 3).\n",
            "   - He was criticized for appointing relatives to key state positions (Information 4).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Based on this information, it seems that Nawaz Sharif has taken some conservative positions, such as consolidating power, appointing family members to government roles, and facing opposition from more liberal/left-leaning groups.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. However, the information also notes that the \"national congress of Brazil elected in 2014 may be considered the most conservative since the redemocratization movement\" (Information 6), suggesting that being \"conservative\" is a relative term that can vary across different political contexts.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Additionally, the information states that \"although rightwing in the past, today it is a moderate liberal-conservative party\" (Information 7), which suggests that Nawaz Sharif's party may have shifted towards a more moderate position over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Overall, based on the information provided, I would say that the claim \"Nawaz Sharif is a conservative politician\" is partially supported, as he has taken some conservative positions, but the extent of his conservatism and the current positioning of his party is not entirely clear. More context would be needed to make a definitive assessment.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. The information does not directly address whether Zemeckis has made movies for adults or not. It provides some background information on Zemeckis' childhood and early experiences with film and television.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The information mentions that Zemeckis was \"fascinated by his parents' 8 mm film home movie camera\" as a child, suggesting an early interest in filmmaking. However, this does not indicate whether he has made movies for adults or not.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The information also mentions that Zemeckis \"encountered a program that was in his words made up of a bunch of hippies and considered an embarrassment by the university\" when he arrived at USC. This suggests that he may have had a different perspective on filmmaking compared to the program at USC, but it does not directly address the claim about his movie-making for adults.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. The information states that Zemeckis and his peers \"were interested in Clint Eastwood and James Bond and Walt Disney because that's how we grew up.\" This indicates that Zemeckis was influenced by popular mainstream films and entertainment, but it does not provide any information about whether he has made movies for adults.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. The information mentions that television gave Zemeckis \"his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing\" and that he learned about the existence of film schools on an episode of \"The Tonight Show.\" This suggests that television and mainstream entertainment played a significant role in Zemeckis' early exposure to the film industry, but it does not directly address the claim about his movie-making for adults.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. The information provided does not contain any specific details about the movies Zemeckis has made or the target audience for those movies. Without this information, it is difficult to determine whether the claim \"Robert Zemeckis has rarely made movies for adults\" is accurate or not.\n",

            "In conclusion, the information provided does not provide enough evidence to either support or refute the claim that Zemeckis has rarely made movies for adults. The information focuses more on Zemeckis' early experiences and influences, but does not directly address his filmography or the target audience for his movies. To verify this claim, additional information about Zemeckis' body of work and the intended audience for his films would be needed.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. The information mentions that Hardwicke \"earned the directing award at Sundance in 2003\" for her film \"Thirteen\". This suggests that she has won at least one major award for her directing work.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The information also states that in 2009, Hardwicke \"was awarded the Women in Film Dorothy Arzner Directors Award\". This is another indication that she has been recognized for her directing achievements.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. While the information does not explicitly state that Hardwicke has won the Academy Award for Best Director or the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, it notes that these are considered \"among the most prestigious awards for directing\". This implies that winning such awards would be a strong indicator of being an \"award-winning\" director.\n",

            "Based on the information provided, the claim that Catherine Hardwicke is an award-winning film director appears to be supported.
