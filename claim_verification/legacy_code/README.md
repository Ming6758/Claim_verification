# Legacy code

In this folder, there are some legacy code. 

We attempted to run pre-training from scratch for the sentence ranking model. This did not give a satisfactory result, so we switched to fine-tuning later (see the current `sentence_ranking` folder).

We also attempted to run the Mistral LLM, but Claude-3 got announced during our project which has much better performance but a similar cost.
